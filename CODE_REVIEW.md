# Code Review

### General
Some notes on the code include:

1. Tests are failing, and that is a big first problem to have before pushing code.
1. libs/books/feature/src/lib tests could use are autogenerated and could still use custom written tests.
1. libs/books/data-access/src/lib/+state is already long and should be modularized to list in future with more pages/sections.

I assume the css class naming convention is book-grid with '-' for a whole item and book--title with '--' for a property of the book, but I would make sure to add clarification comments for things like this for other developers to continue the trend as well.


### Lighthouse Test

Accessability before fixes was 87/100 and after it is 100/100.

The main issue of the lighthouse test includes performance / loading times.  

Things like:
* Compressing Text
* Code Minification
* Treeshaking (Removing unused code)
* Screen Reader Issues (name on buttons)
* Server Payload Optimizations

A lot of these things are fixed by building with production flag and server in production.

Things not listed in lighthouse could be:
* More aria labels and screen reader features
* SEO related issues such as meta tags in head
* Alt text on images
